How to run Pynux:
1) you SHOULD be on windows 10-11 ( and maybe 7 im not sure )
2) first run the run_first.bat to download all requirements for the program to run
3) then run the start.bat and you will be able to use it!

Note:
you will only need to install the main.py , start.bat and run_first.bat , all of the other .txt files are for updates devlogs and reports! so if you want you download them 
it is not needed.
