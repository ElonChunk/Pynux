# How to run Pynux:
1) you SHOULD be on windows 10-11 ( and maybe 7 im not sure )
2) you MUST have python installed
3) run the start.bat and wait till all libraries are installed
4) after waiting it will ask you for admin or no, here you can do whatever you want it, it is reccomended to be a yes for the packages but if you do not trust then it is cool

Note:
you will only need to install the main.py and start.bat. all of the other files are optional

Open-Source!
you can modify it.
